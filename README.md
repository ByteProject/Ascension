# Ascension (public 2.x branch)

This repository is a legacy, containing the very last public source code of my app Ascension. Note that branch 2.x won't be further developed. Since version 3.x, Ascension is not open source anymore.

## Get the latest version

Fortunately Ascension remains actively developed. You can visit the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/ascension/id410426085?mt=12) to get the latest version. You might also be interested in my flagship app [Escapes]((http://escapes.byteproject.net), where a considerably improved variant of Ascension is built-in.

## License

Ascension 2.x is released under a MIT-style license. See the file `LICENSE` for details.
